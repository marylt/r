# 1) Dataset name: Video Game Sales 2019
# 2) This dataset is created by Abdulshaheed Alqunber, who posted this set onto Kaggle
# 3) This dataset contains video game sales within the year 2019. The dataset contains video game 
# titles, genres, publisher, platform, ESRB rating, developer, and graphical data.
# 4) This data is observational, as it takes in data from countless other sources and compiles it 
# into this dataset. This data is secondary.
# 5) A possible independent variable is the User Rating, and a possible dependent variable is the 
# game ranking. A possible research question would be: For video game sales, do  higher user ratings
# lead to a better ranking score?

# 3a) 

# a) The independent variable is the number of microbiota.
# b) The dependent variable are the infants' gross motor skills, perceptual abilities, and language 
# development by age 2.
# c) This study is an observational study.
# d) Possible weaknesses with this study include the issue with a small sample. 60 subjects cannot
# accurately represent the greater population. Another issue is age. The difference between ages 
# observed is not significant enough to ensure accurate change, since motor skills aren't quite 
# significant until later ages.

# 3b)

# a) The independent variables are the caffeinated coffee and the decaffeinated coffee.
# b) The dependent variable is the level of hyperactivity reported by the students.
